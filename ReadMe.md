# TodoList

https://store.kde.org/p/1152230/

Redesigned GUI for the [kdeplasma-addons notes widget](https://github.com/KDE/kdeplasma-addons/tree/master/applets/notes), where it's organized as a list using GUI components.

Depends on the `plasma-widgets-addons` package (`sudo apt install plasma-widgets-addons`) which used to be called `kdeplasma-addons` before it was broken up into 3-4 smaller packages in Ubuntu.
